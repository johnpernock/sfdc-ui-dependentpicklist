# DependentPicklist

Based on a tutorial/example based here - http://sfdcmonkey.com/2018/08/31/dependent-picklist-lightningselect-lightning-salesforce/

## Changes Made From Tutorial Include:
* Making Object / Field Names exposed so we can update data back on the controller from the component
* Adding Labels for the Fields so we can customize those to our liking.
* Added boolean to make the fields required on UI in Lightning
* Added ability to update directly from component for reusability.
* Added spinner to appear over the fields when loading initially from APEX so Users are not confused while values are loading.
